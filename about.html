                <p>
                    Mentors Without Borders is a group of passionate professionals
                    who are teaching young people from all over the world how to 
                    enjoy the process of setting goals and taking steps towards these 
                    goals in their chosen fields. We believe that passion should be 
                    the main driver for everything that our students do because this 
                    is what will make them really efficient in pursuing their dreams.

                <h2>Why Mentors Without Borders</h2>
                <p>
                    Too many teachers worldwide focus on the study materials themselves, 
                    leaving aside the most important aspect in the learning process, which 
                    is that of showing the students how to really enjoy learning and pursuing 
                    their goals. We teach a very simple and efficient method for doing just 
                    that and consequently our students become much more motivated and passionate 
                    about anything they choose to study and pursue in their lives. 
                    Furthermore, they are happy to voluntarily teach the method that they 
                    learned from us to others and in this way the joy of learning spreads 
                    all over the world.
